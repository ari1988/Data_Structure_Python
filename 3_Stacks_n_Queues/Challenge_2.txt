Challenge: Implement Two Stacks Using One List

Problem Statement
Implement the following functions to implement two stacks using a single array such that for storing elements both stacks should use the same array. An illustration is also provided for your understanding. Also, for this problem, initialize a Python list with the provided fixed size and perform all the operations in-place without growing or shrinking the list!

Function Prototypes
```python
  def push1(value): # pushes value in stack 1
  def push2(value): # pushes value in stack 2
  def pop1(): # pops an element from stack 1 
  def pop2():# pops an element from stack 2 

```
Input/Output

push1(value)
Input: an integer
Output: inserts the given value in the first stack, i.e., stack1

push2(value)
Input: an integer
Output: inserts the given value in the second stack i.e stack2

pop1()
Output: returns and removes the top value of stack1

pop2()
Output: returns and removes the top value of stack2
