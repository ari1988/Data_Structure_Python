Challenge: Find Two Numbers that Add up to "k" - Hashing
Given a list and a number "n", find two numbers from the list that sum to "k". 

Problem Statement
In this problem, you have to implement the findSum(lst,k) function which will take a number k as input and return two numbers that add up to k.

You have already seen this in Challenge: Find Two Numbers that Add up to “k”. Here you would use HashTables for a more efficient solution.

Input
A list and a number k

Output
A list with two integers a and b that add up to k

Sample Input
lst = [1,21,3,14,5,60,7,6]
k = 81

Sample Output
lst = [21,60]
