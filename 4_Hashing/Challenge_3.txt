Challenge: Find Symmetric Pairs in a List

Problem Statement
By definition, (a, b) and (c, d) are symmetric pairs iff, a = d and b = c. In this problem, you have to implement the find_symmetric(list) function which will find all the symmetric pairs in a given list.

Input
A list.

Output
A list containing all the symmetric pairs of elements in the input list.

Sample Input
list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 9], [4, 3], [9, 5]]

Sample Output
[[3, 4], [4, 3], [5, 9], [9, 5]]
