##  The size of Queue should be 1 more than the number because, for a single number, 
# weâ€™re enqueuing two variations of it, one with appended 0 while the other with 1 being appended.

## Time Complexity
## he time complexity of this solution is in O(n) as constant-time operations are executed for n times.
