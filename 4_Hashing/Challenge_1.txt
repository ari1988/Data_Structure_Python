Challenge: A List as a Subset of Another List

Problem Statement
Implement the is_subset(list1,list2) function which will takes two lists as input and checks whether one list is the subset of the other. This method is already available in Python, but weâ€™ll be implementing it using hash tables.

Note: The input lists do not contain duplicate values.

Use the Python set as your hash table.

Input
Two lists of integers.

Output
True if list2 is a subset of list1.

Sample Input
list1 = [9,4,7,1,-2,6,5]
list2 = [7,1,-2]

Sample Output
True
