Challenge: Rearrange Sorted List in Max/Min Form

Problem Statement
Implement a function called max_min(lst) which will re-arrange the elements of a sorted list such that the 0th index will have the largest number, 
the 1st index will have the smallest, and the 2nd index will have second-largest, and so on. 
In other words, all the even-numbered indices will have the largest numbers in the list in descending order and 
the odd-numbered indices will have the smallest numbers in ascending order.

Input:
A sorted list

Output:
A list with elements stored in max/min form

Sample Input
lst = [1,2,3,4,5]

Sample Output
lst = [5,1,4,2,3]
