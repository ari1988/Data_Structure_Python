Challenge: Find Two Pairs in List such that a+b = c+d

Problem Statement
In this problem, you have to implement the find_pair() function which will find two pairs, [a, b] and [c, d], in a list such that :
a+b=c+d

You only have to find the first two pairs in the list which satisfies the above condition.

Input
A list of distinct integers.

Output
A list containing two pairs, (a, b) and (c, d), which satisfy a + b = c + d

Sample Input
my_list = [3, 4, 7, 1, 12, 9]

Sample Output
[[4,12],[7,9]]
