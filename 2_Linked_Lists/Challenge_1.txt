Challenge: Insertion at Tail

Problem Statement
Just as heads and tails are polar opposites, this function is the opposite of what we saw in the last lesson. However, it is just as simple.

We need to insert a new object at the end of the linked list. You can naturally guess, that this newly added node will point to None as it is at the tail.

Input
A linked list and an integer value.

Output
The updated linked list with the value inserted.

Sample Input
Linked List = 0->1->2
integer = 3

Sample Output
Linked List = 0->1->2->3
